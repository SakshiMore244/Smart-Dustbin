# Smart-Dustbin
This project is designed to help overall human beings by reducing the risk of contamination of the hospital cleanliness staff, and other household uses by a contactless collection of the waste.
This project work is the implementation of smart dustbin using an Ultrasonicsensor, IR sensor, Moisture sensor, Raspberry Pi, Buzzer and Servo Motor.
This system assures the cleaning of dustbins soon when the garbage level reaches its maximum. It will take DC 5V power supply.
This Project also segregate the dry waste and wet waste using moisture sensor. The record is sent to the Sweeper or higher authority who can take appropriate action against the concerned contractor when the dustbin gets full. This system also helps to monitor the fake reports and hence can reduce the
corruption in the overall management system. This reduces the total number of trips of garbage collection vehicles and hence reduces the overall expenditure associated with the garbage collection. It ultimately helps to keep cleanliness in society. Therefore, a smart dustbin makes the garbage collection more efficient.
